Scenario:
You are building a custom greeting system for a multinational company. Employees 
belong to different departments, and the company wants to send personalized greetings 
based on department and time of day.
You need to create a function that stores the department name and the company name, 
and returns another function (closure) that can generate greetings for employees using 
their first name, last name, and time of day.

Requirements:
Create a function greetingGenerator(department, company) that returns another function.
The returned function should take three arguments: firstName, lastName, and timeOfDay 
(morning, afternoon, evening).
The returned function should print a personalized greeting in the format:
Good <timeOfDay>, <firstName> <lastName>! Welcome to the <department> department 
at <company>.
Demonstrate using this closure for at least 3 employees in the same department.

Sample output:
Good morning, Alice Johnson! Welcome to the Marketing department at TechCorp.
Good afternoon, Bob Smith! Welcome to the Marketing department at TechCorp.
Good evening, Charlie Brown! Welcome to the Marketing department at TechCorp.
